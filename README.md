## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shubhi Srivastava, an avid UX enthusiast who loves both design and development. 
I am always open to learning new skills, and collaborating on projects that allow me to think out of the box and set my brain on fire. 

If you are someone looking to work with a developer who can also get their hands dirty on Figma, who isn't picky about the tech stack they work with (and can learn fast on the job), hit me up on LinkedIn, or send me a quick email at shubhisriv1998@gmail.com!

My current skills and tools: Figma, React.js, Javascript, Typescript, HTML+CSS, Tailwind CSS
