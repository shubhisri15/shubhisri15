## Hi there 👋

My name is Shubhi Srivastava, a frontend-heavy Fullstack Engineer, and a UX enthusiast who loves both design and development. (I also occasionally run away to offbeat places around the world). 

My skills and tools: React.js, Javascript, Typescript, HTML+CSS, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, GraphQL, REST, Java, Spring.

I am always open to learning new skills, and collaborating on projects that allow me to think out of the box and set my brain on fire. So if you are someone looking to work with a Frontend / Fullstack Developer who understands UX thinking, and loves complex problem solving, hit me up on LinkedIn, or send me an email at shubhisriv1998@gmail.com!
