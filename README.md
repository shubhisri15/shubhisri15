## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shubhi Srivastava, an avid UX enthusiast who loves both design and development.

My current skills and tools: Figma, React.js, Javascript, Typescript, HTML+CSS, Tailwind CSS, Netlify (and some fooling around with Next.js).

I am always open to learning new skills, and collaborating on projects that allow me to think out of the box and set my brain on fire. 

If you are someone looking to work with a Frontend / Web Developer who can get their hands dirty on Figma, understands UX thinking, and loves complex problem solving, hit me up on LinkedIn, or send me an email at shubhisriv1998@gmail.com!
